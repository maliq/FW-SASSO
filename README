 
* THE SASSO IMPLEMENTED VIA FRANK-WOLFE.


* DETERMISTIC VERSION FULLY TESTED AND IMPLEMENTED WITH RECURSIVE GRADIENT UPDATES AND A SPECIAL CACHE DATA STRUCTURE (MCACHE) DESIGNED TO STORE ENTIRE COLUMNS OF THE KERNEL MATRIX. THIS RESULTS MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD SCACHE IN THIS SETTING (DETERMISTIC).
* THE MODELS COMPUTED ALONG THE PATH ARE SAVED, AS USUAL, TO THE RESULTS FILE, BUT ARE ALSO SAVED FOR FURTHER PROCESSING.
* TESTING OF THE MODELS COMPUTED ALONG THE PATH IS EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENTED USING AN SPECIAL DATA STRUCTURE (TEST KERNEL). 
* THE LATTER CAN BE APPLIED IMMEDIATLY AFTER COMPUTING THE PATH, OR FROM SCRATCH PROVIDING THE NAME OF THE RESULTS FILE.

* RANDOMIZED VERSION WORKS BUT HAS NOT BEEN OPTIMIZED IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY.
* PROBABLY, IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO ADD THE RECURSIVE COMPUTATION OF THE GRADIENTS CORRESPONDING TO ACTIVE POINTS.
